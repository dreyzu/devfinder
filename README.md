### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
